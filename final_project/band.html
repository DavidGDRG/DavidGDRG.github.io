        <h1><strong><em>Marching Band</em></strong></h1>
        <p>
            ----- I have been in marching band for 3 years now and have been a big part of my high school life. It has
            helped
            me
            find new friendships that I would have never had if I wasn't in it. I was able to learn and play a new
            instrument, a mellophone (marching french horn). I have been to too many football games and so many
            competitions
            most in-state but others outside of Ohio, mainly in indiana. Every year we have a trip to Indy where we go
            perform at Lucas Oil Stadium for our Super Regional Competition. This past Indy trip we placed 33'rd out of
            87
            different bands. I have sustained many injuries because of marching band, such as a few sprained ankles,
            hearing
            problems and neck/back problems. My favorite show that I've been a part of was my very first year during the
            Everest show. The music was amazing and the visuals were too. I wish I did marching band my freshman year
            but
            I'm also glad I didn't. Because if I did I would have even more injuries now. The 3 shows that I've been in
            are
            As I mentioned before Everest, my sophomore year. Maps and Legends, my junior year. Then Relic, my senior
            year.

        <h1><strong><em>Athletic Band</em></strong></h1>
        <p>
            ----- Athletic Band is where you play during basketball games instead of football games. It's indoors and a
            lot
            more
            relaxing, It only costs $10-$15 to participate in. You get to play a whole lot more fun toons such as Land
            of
            1000 dances, 25 or 6 to 4, BuckJump, and Bad Romance. There are usually a lot less people who participate in
            it
            which is actually perfect and anyone can join it no matter if they were in marching band before or not. Game
            days are usually only on Thursday or Friday nights every week or every other week. It's usually more fun and
            chill, you can play music and hangout with friends. You don't have a bulky uniform on that is just a boiler
            either. I love Athletic Band, and it'll always be my favorite "sport" that rivals or just overcomes Marching
            Band.
