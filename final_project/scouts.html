        <h1><strong><em>Scouts</em></strong></h1>
        <p>
            ----- Boy Scouts, which has been recently renamed to just Scouts, is an organization that brings youth
            together
            and
            teaches them leadership skills that they use in the future. I have been a part of Scouts since I was in 3'rd
            grade. I've learned important skills such as cooking, leading a group of people, wilderness survival and
            first
            aid, aquatics safety/rescue and many more. I joined scouts for the fun of camping and the different things I
            could learn. I'm currently in the tenderfoot rank and plan on getting first class before I age out.

        <h2><strong><em>High Adventure #1</em></strong></h2>
        <p>
            ----- High adventures are big trips that troops take that usually are several weeks long. The hardest and
            most
            physically straining one I have been on so far is called Philmont. Philmont is a almost 2 week long camping
            trip
            over the summer where you are flown out to Utah and then to the Philmont mountains in New Mexico. You carry
            all
            of your camping gear, tents, food, cooking, supplies and trash on you during the trip. There are toilets at
            every campsite but not so much along the trails but, usually you have to dig a hole or go in a bush if you
            need
            to use the bathroom. I was in a crew of 8 people, we hiked for 9 days and did 84 miles, saw many amazing
            views
            and sceneries and I would most definitely do it all over again.

        <h2><strong><em>High Adventure #2</em></strong></h2>
        <p>
            ----- Another High Adventure that I've been on is called GOBA (Great Ohio Biking Adventure). It was over the
            summer of
            2024 and consisted of riding a bike from city-to-city. My troop did multiple practice training rides leading
            up
            to the high adventure to prepare everyone for the pain and strain on their legs. At the start of the GOBA
            ride
            my group got into a big crash. 2 people collided in the front resulting in minor injuries, an adult on a
            sitting
            bike had to suddenly stop and turned sideways, causing me to crash into them and flipping them and myself
            over.
            Then another adult crashed into us causing my bike to go on top of me and sending them flying forward. The
            sitting bike got disabled for the rest of the GOBA ride and me and the other adult sustained a lot of road
            rashes and bruises. It was fun but painful and I would only do it again if it was less hot.
