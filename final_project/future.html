<h1><strong><em>My Cats</em></strong></h1>
<p>
    I own 2 very beautiful and adorable cats, they are both extremely loving and soft. They are brother and
            sister, born from a little of 6 kittens. One is really fluffy. He sheds so much hair all of the time and
            when you put your hand in his fur it just gets lost in it. Fluffy usually sits on top of his cat tree
            waiting for someone to walk by so he can swapt at them from above. At times he plays hard to get and will
            keep walking away when trying to pet him, until he finds a comfy spot to lay down in or he will seek you out
            and scratch/meow at you whether you are in a room or relaxing watching some TV.

            My other cat's  is a hyper little (ish) ball that loves to meow constantly…. Constantly…..
            (like all the time) until you give her attention, if you try to leave she will claw at you to get you to
            return as well as jump up onto you. If you're sitting she becomes a parrot, if you're standing she becomes a
            chihuahua.
