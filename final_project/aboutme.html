        <h1><strong><em>About Me</em></strong></h1>
        <p>
            ----- My name is David Lewis, I live with my mom, my dad, 2 cats, 2 dogs, a tortoise and some fish, with a
            sister
            off
            at
            college. I go to Kettering Fairmont High School where I am apart of many different activities. I'm also a
            really
            outdoorsy person and love to go camping and hiking. I'm into hardware such as building pc's and taking apart
            electronics. I love listening and playing music. I have played the french horn for 6 years now (2024). As
            well
            as my
            temps license. In my spare time I either play games on my pc, switch, oculus or 3ds. Go on adventures (trips
            or
            bike
            rides). Or hanging out with friends and with pets. My favorite game serieses are twisted metal, the
            Kirby
            games, CODM, Untuned which I have over 1000 hours in and ARK which I have close to 2500 hours or more in.
            My favorite music artists are Panic at The Disco!, Poor Mans Poison, and Imagine Dragons.

        <h1><strong><em>Academics</em></strong></h1>
        <p>
            ----- I'm currently planning on going to Sinclar community college for 2 years to either study in a hardware
            I.T. field, or into a science field related to geology or paleontology. After Sinclair I plan on
            transferring to
            Wright State for either 2-4 more years, finishing my college education. So far I have gained multiple
            Sinclair
            credits already from the I.T. course I've been in in. As well as multiple certifications in coding.

        <h1><strong><em>Struggles</em></strong></h1>
        <p>
            ----- Throughout my highschool and schooling career I've been troubled with staying on task and keeping up
            with my homework. I have ADHD which is one of the most prevalent causes of these issues, currently (as of
            October 2024) I am not on any medication. Toward the end of my Junior year and now at the start of my Senior
            year I have been able to overcome these challenges. I've been more on task with my work and have gotten my
            assignment turned in on time and done in class so I can have more time at home to rest and do fun stuff
            instead of spending all day like I used to do, working.
